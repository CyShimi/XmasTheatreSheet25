We slid back into the North Pole, boots crunchin’ in the snow,
But the workshop lights were dark and the wind said no one’s home.
Garbage piled by the doorstep, letters torn and left unread
Only the old red sleigh, lonely in the yard like,
“Yeah… something’s wrong,” it said.

Where are the bells?
Where’s the jolly laugh?
We checked the list twice
And he ain’t on the map.

Where did Santa go-oh-oh?
Snow is fallin’, but he’s gone like who knows
Sleigh’s still waitin’, deer tracks faded,
Christmas magic deactivated!
So we call our friends
"You know who bends the seasons when she dances in the snow!"
And our fox-eared menace shows
Already sittin’ in the back of the sleigh like:
“Step on it, bro.”


Down from her forest she came, lights tangled in her antlers,
Hooves prancin’ sparks, grinning like the fifth season’s anthem.
And our nine-tailed slacker?
Should’ve been in beast-mode pulling the sleigh
But he’s loungin’, phone buzzing,
Like he teleported here yesterday.

Feel the winds shift
Feel the night hum
Something stole the Santa star,
And we’re the ones who run.

Where did Santa go-oh-oh? "Ho-Ho-Ho!"
Candy canes trembling, tinsel in vertigo
If he’s missing, Christmas fizzles,
So we light up all our sigils!
Grab the reins, spark the runes,
Stack the sleigh with holiday goons
Tonight we ride into the unknown,
Till we drag that Santa home!


“Okay, move. I’m installing the engine.”
“WHY does a sleigh even have a missile bracket??”
“Wake me when we breach the stratosphere.”

Hanabira slams the ignition core: "Let's Go! .... Fireball!"


Where did Santa go-o-o-o

That’s how long it takes for the dust to remember it was once a mountain.
For a sleigh to stop spinning.
For four idiot sand one very determined fox—to reconsider every life choice that led them to crash-land Santa’s ride onto the Moon.

I open my eyes.

There is… silence.
A silence so thick it presses against my ribs like an unspoken confession.
Through it, I hear Cype somewhere behind me, face-first in lunar dust,
muttering code at the ground
as if debugging gravity itself.

To my left, Cho floats
not majestically, no
more like a confused piece of laundry caught in a cosmic cross-breeze.
Arms drifting.
Hair drifting.
Soul… drifting harder.

Nemo appears from behind a boulder he absolutely should not fit behind.
He looks at us.
We look at him.
He shrugs.
We accept this as normal.

And May…
May’s antlers are glowing like a sentient Christmas tree having a spiritual awakening.
Electrostatic lights flickering in patterns that definitely mean something,
though none of us are fluent in reindeer prophecy.

Then
the shadow falls.

Long.
Wide.
Unforgiving.

It crawls across the Mare Tranquillitatis
like a reminder that legends… are only fun until you disappoint one.

A low rumble.
A jingle.
A resonance felt more through bone than ear.

And there he stands.

Santa.
Not jolly,
not round,
but ancient
as if every chimney ever visited carved a wrinkle into his timeline.
Coat torn at the edges.
Boots scorched by re-entry.
Beard glowing faintly with cosmic microwave background radiation.

He looks at us.

We look back.

And in that stare,
oh, in that PRESSURE of disappointed omnipotence
I understand something profound:

We have not simply crashed a sleigh.
We have committed a mythological oshi violation.

He inhales.
The Moon trembles.

He speaks.

Not loudly.
No.
Quietly.
Dangerously.
As if choosing which one of us he’s going to promote directly to ghost.

“Children,”
he says,
“explain.”

But how do you explain ignition?
How do you explain an experimental rocket booster duct-taped to a centuries-old magical vehicle?
How do you explain Hanabira-at-the-controls,
high on adrenaline and questionable engineering,
screaming:

“PUNCH IT.”

How do you explain
that for one brief, impossible, glorious moment
—the sleigh FLEW FASTER THAN HOPE
before deciding it wanted to become part of the Moon?

I step forward.

I clear my throat.

I say the only thing that feels honest,
cosmic,
and entirely inadequate in the presence of a furious winter demigod:

“…Surprise?”

Santa closes his eyes.
Exhales.
Somewhere, a star dies just to avoid witnessing this interaction.

Behind me, Cype raises a hand weakly.
“We can… fix it?” she offers.

May jingles apologetically.

Nemo pretends to be dead.

Cho salutes for absolutely no reason.

And me?

I stand there.
Moon dust swirling around my boots.
Tail flicking like a guilty metronome.
Heart glowing like the world’s worst Christmas ornament.

Because in that moment…
in the ruins of the sleigh…
surrounded by chaos and friends and cosmic embarrassment…

I realize something:

There is no better place to be
than ten seconds after impact
with the people who hit the Moon with you.`).trim() }],

The Moon trembles again.
Santa steps forward no longer the cozy father-figure of old myths,
but a weary general of a universe that refuses to behave.

His boots crunch in the Lunar dust.
His shadow falls across all of us like the threat of an overdue apocalypse.

He inhales.

And begins:

"You think the sleigh crash is why I’m angry?”

His voice rumbles like a glacier threatening to stand up and walk away.

“No.
No, no, no.
2025 is why I’m angry.”

He raises one gloved hand, fingers trembling not with age,
but with the restraint of someone trying not to vaporize an entire planet out of irritation.

“Let me summarize this year for you.
One continent is on fire.
Another is underwater.
Someone put AI-generated reindeer on Etsy
and they have SIX LEGS.
Do you know how many letters I received asking me
to ‘fix the economy,’
‘fix the climate,’
‘fix their relationship,’
‘fix the lore of their favorite franchise,’
and one child—ONE—
asked me to turn his older brother into a raccoon.”

He pinches the bridge of his nose.

“Meanwhile…
my sleigh insurance premium QUADRUPLED.
The elves unionized.
The reindeer want hazard pay.
Rudolph got cancelled on social media for a week
don’t ask.
You know what my North Pole looks like now?
A logistical nightmare powered by lukewarm cocoa
and the last three shreds of my sanity.”

He gestures at our crashed sleigh crater.

“And then…
you four
decide to turn my primary mode of magical transportation
into a METEOR.”

Santa steps closer.
Cho gulps.
Cype slowly lowers her glowing palm.
Nemo pretends to be part of the terrain.
May jingles nervously.
Santa leans in.


“…But you know what?

Maybe this is exactly what I needed.”

A slow grin cracks his ancient face.

Maybe this year doesn’t need saving.
Maybe it needs a RESET BUTTON.

He stretches his arms wide.
Lunar dust rises into spirals behind him.
The sleigh wreckage glows like a charging reactor.

“SO
if we’re going to fix 2025…”

His voice drops to a whisper.

“…we’re going to do it LOUD.”

A deep jingle shakes the Moon.
Drums begin.
Synths coil like northern lights.
Bass drops like a collapsing star.

“YO!

CRASH CREW
HO-HO-HO! HOLD ONTO SOMETHING.”

When I said your name
Heat learns how to listen
When you breathe the flame

I feel the sleigh still shaking
But my heart stands still
Christmas in my ribcage
Plasma bending will

If this is where we break
Let it be bright
If this is where we land
Let it be light

Hold me
In the fire
Don’t look down
We’re higher

Snow and sparks
Same design
Every second
Is still mine

I see the fear in their eyes
Like glass about to sing
But I learned how to dance
Inside the burning ring

If this is what forever costs
I’ll pay it warm and loud
Christmas baby in the storm
Head in sparks, not bowed

I am not falling
I am arriving
The fire knows my shape

Hold me
In the fire
Say my name
Don’t rewind

Sleigh still flying
World in view
Time can wait
I’m with you

Force.

Cosmic Christmas love.

Wrong sky. Wrong year.
Santa blinks.
Mirrorballs everywhere.
…oh.

Snow on the pavement, heat in the air
Polyester dreams and glittered stares
Santa’s got a halo made of chrome
I just smile like I'm already home

Door swings open  velvet rope
The bouncer’s name is L.O.V.E., he just nods “go”
No questions, no delay
The future hums when the lights obey

Step inside, let the lights decide
No questions asked, just feel that ride
Spin it up, don’t ask why
Christmas lives when the needle flies

Needle flies…
Needle flies…
Hands up  hold the night
Don’t blink 

Disco Christmas  don't stop now
Disco Christmas  show us how
Disco Christmas  dance all night
Disco Christmas  dance with Cype!

Time slipped sideways, nobody cares
Bell-bottom angels on the stairs
May’s still laughing, Nemo’s stunned
I touch vinyl  countdown begun

Clock’s not real, the beat is true
Every year collapses into the groove
Hold on tight, feel that rise
History bends when the needle flies

Step inside, let the lights decide
No questions asked, just feel that ride
Spin it up, don’t ask why
Christmas lives when the needle flies

Needle flies…

May smells the weed before she sees fire
Nemo squints at the sun
I already tied the bandana

Air so thick it bends the light
Your neighbor’s colors leak into mine
Someone’s burning something sacred
or maybe just really good weed

No tickets, no stage list
Names dissolve in the heat
Time folds itself politely
and waits outside the beat

“Strawberry,” they say, smiling
like they’ve seen this before
I don't ask why
I'm already stepping forward

Turn it up, don’t tell me where
Let the sound decide
Hands in the sky, feet in the dirt
Midriff in the firelight

Ring the strings till the stars blur
Let the sleigh become the stage
Christmas caught in feedback
Santa’s laughing off his age

Thirty minutes or forever
Hard to tell, nobody cares
Guitar crying sweet confessions
to an audience not there

Every note a small rebellion
Every bend a holy lie
Peace signs stitched with burn marks
Truth hidden in the sky

They said the future was coming
but it’s been here all night
You don’t save the world with rules
you save it with light

So turn it up, don’t bring me back
Let the moment stay
If Christmas needs saving
it’s already on its way

Ring the strings till the stars blur
Let the sleigh become the stage
Christmas caught in feedback
Santa’s laughing off his age

So turn it bright.
So turn it up

Ho ho  drop that sound
Christmas rave, let it spin around

BOOM  sleigh hits ice, sparks still glowing
Time snaps back like nothing’s broken
Santa’s home but the lights stay on
‘Cause somebody ran the place just fine while he was gone

Elfo at the helm, clipboard magic
Read the signs, never panicked
Heard the songs, felt the signal
“Yeah  we’re good. This was always cyclical.”

Clock loops closed, bells all ringing
Factory hums, subwoofers singing
Step inside, don’t ask why
North Pole ready  tonight’s alive

Orange cat DJ on the factory roof
Laser pointer, bulletproof groove
Pete still dancing  decades deep
Swinging bones like he never needs sleep

Cho in the crowd, lost in the beat
Kicks one leg, laughs with Pete
Tunnel vision, punch bass glow
Nemo melting from tempo

VIP chill  Mizu leans back
Poopah squad just vibing intact
Yeti passing snowcones fast
McGwerk eating all of them  none left, sad

Chloé patched the locks, system tight
Santa nods like “yeah, that’s right”
Everything’s fine  no alarms
Just bass, bells, frost, and charm

Arms crossed like they already knew

She gulps once  waits for blame

They laugh, smile, pat her head
“Relax. Keep it. Consider it…
borrowed.”
Tail flicks, beat drops harder
Problem solved by tomorrow

The Loon in the rafters crafting snow by hand
Blueprints in the beat like a wonderland
Whiteout spirals falling on the floor
Lexxxii in the back brewing trances for more
Pera in the crowd, both hands to the sky
Dancing back to back with if it flies it fries
And noOpnet pulling off headspins
Going all-in with Bewm fighting a spin to win

North Pole  hands up high
Snow in the air, let the bass fly
All night  neon lights
Christmas rave ‘til the sunrise

North Pole  don’t slow down
Sleigh hit the ground, now we shake the town
Ho ho  drop that sound
Christmas rave, let it spin around

Avery watching elves through candy-cane bars
Smiles like “yeah… this went pretty far”
Rawriz sliding in, tools in hand
Splitting up the cages like it’s all planned

May by the heaters, cocoa on deck
Keeping hearts warm, Mild's double-checking the tech
Split walks past, shirt halfway gone
Abs flash once  and Chloé's done

Laughter bouncing off frosted steel
Every corner humming  this one’s real

Cap locks hands, steady and sure
Star climbs, laughing, pure
Step by step up the frozen frame
North Pole holding its breath again

Higher still  lights fall quiet
Even the bass learns how to be silent
She reaches the top, arms open wide
Cap below with a grin full of pride

Then she shines  no filter, no lie
Brightest star in the northern sky
Not just a light but a promise afar
The North Pole’s heart
A Christmas star

North Pole  hands up high
Snow in the air, let the bass fly
All night  neon lights
Christmas rave ‘til the sunrise

North Pole  don’t slow down
Sleigh hit the ground, now we shake the town
Ho ho  drop that sound
Christmas rave, let it spin around

“Thank you for this year,” no mic, no show
Just a nod that says yeah  you know
Chat’s the gift we never could buy
Every late night, every shared sky

Hands go up, no need to say more
This party doesn’t need us anymore

Rave on  don’t let it fade
Carry the sparks we made
Through midnight hours, through New Year’s dawn
This beat lives on  even when we’re gone

Bells ring low, bass drifts wide
Snow falls slow on the after-vibe
North Pole glowing, year complete
Same friends, same fire  next heartbeat
